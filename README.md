Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.

What I learned
This challenge strengthened my knowledge in ordered and unordered lists, how to use it and when to use it.

Continued development
I tried using the break tag but i found out that the paragraph tag did what i needed it to do and even better. I also need to work on polishing my css on what styles to us efor what.
